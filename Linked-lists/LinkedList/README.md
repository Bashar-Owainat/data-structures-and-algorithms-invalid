# Singly Linked List
## Summary
I did an implementation for SLL with two classes that are called SLL and Node

## Challenge
In the SLL class there are 3 methods:
1-Insert
2-Includes
3-ToStringMethod

In the Node class there are two properties:
1-value
2-next

and I created 7 test methods to test some functionality:
1-EmptyInstantiation
2-Insert
3-PointAtHead
4-InsertMultipleNodes
5-FindValue
6-ValueNotFound
7-RetunValues

## Approach & Efficiency
Insert = O(1)
Includes = O(n)
ToStringMethod = O(n)

## API
Insert: it adds a given value to the head and it works with empty lists.

Includes: It checks if a given value is included in the SLL.

ToStringMethid: it prints the SLL in the following format:

[1] -> [2] -> [3] -> NULL
